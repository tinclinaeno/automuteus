One of the most striking aspects of An Insignificant Man is the use of real footage and audio recordings from the AAP's campaign. The filmmakers did not use any voice-over narration, interviews, or re-enactments to tell the story. Instead, they let the events unfold on the screen as they happened, creating a sense of immediacy and authenticity. The film also uses music and editing to create tension and emotion, without compromising on the factual accuracy.
 
The film also features some memorable moments and characters from the AAP's journey. For instance, the film shows how Arvind Kejriwal transformed from a shy and reluctant leader to a charismatic and confident politician. It also shows how Santosh Koli, a young and fearless activist, became one of the key members of AAP, before her tragic death in a road accident. The film also captures the highs and lows of the AAP's campaign, such as their massive rally at Ramlila Maidan, their clash with the police at Rajghat, their surprise victory in the Delhi elections, and their subsequent resignation after 49 days in power.
 
An Insignificant Man is not only a documentary about a political party, but also a testament to the power of documentary filmmaking. The film has been praised by critics and audiences alike for its honesty, courage, and impact. The film has also sparked debates and discussions on various issues related to Indian politics and society. The film has been described as a "game-changer" for Indian cinema and democracy.
