# How to Get a TeamSpeak 3 License Key.dat File
 
TeamSpeak 3 is a popular voice communication software that allows you to chat with your friends, teammates, or colleagues over the internet. You can use TeamSpeak 3 for free on public servers, or you can host your own private server with a license key.dat file. A license key.dat file is a file that contains information about your TeamSpeak 3 server, such as the number of slots, the server name, and the expiration date. A license key.dat file is required if you want to host more than 32 slots on your server, or if you want to use some advanced features such as custom branding or priority support.
